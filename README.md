# 2Q implementation and performance comparison

This repository contains the code to the final assignment of the module "Systemsoftware" at the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena 2022.



# Compiling

To compile this project install the .NET 6 SDK and optionally Visual Studio 2022.



# Running

After compiling the program can be run with the following command:

`Cache.Benchmarks.exe {Path to output dir}`

e.g.: `Cache.Benchmarks.exe C:\Users\lschumacher\TwoQueueBenchmarks\`

The path should be accessible to the current user and preferably an empty directory since the program writes a seperate file for each benchmark.



Be ware that the generation of data etc. takes a long time and this program can easily take up to 5 hours to complete all benchmarks.
